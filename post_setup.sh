# The amazon-ssm-agent package in the stable channel is typically out-dated.
# In order to pull the latest stable version, Amazon recommends switching to the candidate channel.
# Also, the snap version of amazon-ssm-agent does not actually sync correctly with the service.
# Amazon recommends copying the data from the snap dir to one under /etc in order to collect logs correctly:
